# Kickstarter Project
This project is focused on predicting whether or not a Kickstarter project will be successful or not. It makes use of the [Kickstarter dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects) on Kaggle. A number of models are implemented using Scikit-Learn, the best performing models, a Random Forest, a Decision Tree, an Adaboost Classifier and a GradientBoosting Classifier, were all combined to form a simple voting ensemble model. The hyper-parameters for the Random Forest and Decision Tree models were found using cross-validation grid search, the training of the Adaboost and Gradient Boosting classifiers was too time consuming to perform a grid search. The voting ensemble model was the best performing model in terms of **Area under the ROC Curve (AUC)**, achieving a score of **0.7452**. While this score may not seem high, it outperforms a number of other more complex models on Kaggle. This shows that even relatively straightfoward models can achieve a higher performance when more focus is put on the feature engineering side of the machine learning pipeline.
